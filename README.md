# Algorithms Challenge Repository [day 7 of 30]

This is repository for my challenge: complete all Data Structures and Algorithms (course from leetcode) for 1 month

#### All my solutions to problems by topic:

- Arrays and strings
- Hashing
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs
- Heaps
- Greedy
- Binary search
- Backtracking
- Dynamic programming

#### For what all this?

I know Java well and write code. But I want to dive deeper into algorithms and data structures, so I decided to arrange such a challenge to study them.
Also this is link to my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/queenofmadhouse/) profile
